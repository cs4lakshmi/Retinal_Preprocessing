# Retinal_Preprocessing
Image Preprocessing Techniques for Automated Retinal Disease Diagnosis

This project consists of Python programs that plots the model's accuaracy/precision when different image preprocessing techniques are being applied.

# nopreprocessing.ipynb
This file plots the model's accuracy/precision when no preprocessing techniques are applied.

# normalization.ipynb
This file plots the model's accuracy/precision when the normalization preprocessing technique is applied.

# rescaling.ipynb
This file plot the model's accuracy/precision when the rescaling preprocessing technique is applied.

# rgbtobgr.ipynb
This file plots the model's accuracy/precision when the images are converted from RGB to BGR.

# standardization.ipynb
This file plots the model's accuracy/precision when the standardization preprocessing technique is appleid.
